Question 2:

a. As offshore height increases between settings, wave height and relative wave height do not see much of a difference.
b. Breakpoint goes closer to shore as offshore height increases.
c. Changes in wave period do not change the shape of wave height and relative wave height plots much.
d. Breakpoint goes further from shore as wave period increases (assuming the same offshore height).
