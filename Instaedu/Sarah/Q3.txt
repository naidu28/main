Q3:

An increasing wave height causes wave breaking closer to shore.
Increasing wave height (given constant wave period) implies increasing amplitudes, meaning greater energy, explaining the change in breakpoint.
An increasing wave period causes wave breaking further from shore.
Increasing wave period (given constant height) implies decreasing amplitudes, meaning less energy, explaining the change in breakpoint.
Aside from breaking point, Hmax and the its cross-shore location remain unchanged with wave period, but is directly affected by offshore wave height.
