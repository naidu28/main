<h1>History</h1>
The term "crowdsourcing" is a portmanteau of "crowd" and "outsourcing," coined by Steve Jurvetson online and then published by Jeff Howe in a June 2006 Wired magazine article "The Rise of Crowdsourcing".[1] It has been argued that crowdsourcing can only exist on the Internet and is thus a relatively recent phenomenon;[3] however, long before modern crowdsourcing systems were developed, there were a number of notable examples of projects that utilized distributed people to help accomplish tasks. Historical examples include:
<h3>The Oxford English Dictionary</h3>
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) may provide one of the earliest examples of crowdsourcing. An open call was made to the community for contributions by volunteers to index all words in the English language and example quotations of their usages for each one. They received over 6 million submissions over a period of 70 years. The making of the OED is detailed in The Surgeon of Crowthorne, by Simon Winchester.[7]
<h3>Early crowdsourcing competitions</h3>
Crowdsourcing has often been used in the past as a competition in order to discover a solution. The French government proposed several of these competitions, often rewarded with Montyon Prizes, created for poor Frenchmen who had done virtuous acts.[9] These included the Leblanc process, or the Alkali Prize, where a reward was provided for separating the salt from the alkali, and the Fourneyron's Turbine, when the first hydraulic commercial turbine was developed.[10]
In response to a challenge from the French government, Nicholas Appert won a prize for inventing a new way of food preservation that involved sealing food in air-tight jars.[11] The British government provided a similar reward to find an easy way to determine a ship's longitude in the The Longitude Prize. During the Great Depression, out-of-work clerks tabulated higher mathematical functions in the Mathematical Tables Project as an outreach project.[12]
