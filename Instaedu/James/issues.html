<h1>Ethical Issues in Crowdsourcing</h1>
There are ethical concerns. Because crowdworkers are considered independent contractors rather than employees, they are not guaranteed a minimum wage. In practice, workers using the Amazon Mechanical Turk generally earn less than the minimum wage, even in India.[39][56] Some researchers who have considered using Mechanical Turk to get participants, for research studies, have argued that the wage conditions might be unethical.[35][57]
With below-market wages, the average US user of Mechanical Turk earned $2.30 per hour for tasks in 2009, versus $1.58 for the average India-based worker. While the majority of users worked less than 5 hours per week, 18% worked 15 hours per week or more, and 27% of Indian users said income from Mechanical Turk is sometimes or always necessary for them to make ends meet. This is less than minimum wage in either country, which Ross et al. suggest raises ethical questions for researchers who use crowdsourcing.[39] When Facebook began its localization program in 2008, it received criticism for using crowdsourcing to obtain free labor.[53]
Typically, no written contracts, non-disclosure agreements, or employee agreements are made with crowdsourced employees. For users of the Amazon Mechanical Turk, this means that requestors have final say over whether users' work is acceptable; if not, they will not be paid.[58] Critics claim that crowdsourcing arrangements exploit individuals in the crowd, and there has been a call for crowds to organize for their labor rights.[45]
Difficulties in collaboration of crowd members, especially in the context of competitive crowd sourcing. Crowdsourcing site InnoCentive allows organizations to solicit solutions to scientific and technological problems; only 10.6% of respondents report working in a team on their submission.[42]
